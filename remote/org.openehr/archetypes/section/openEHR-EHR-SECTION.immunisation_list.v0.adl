This archetype is intended to be used within the COMPOSITION.vaccination_list or as one component of other COMPOSITION archetypes. For example: complex documents, such as a referral.

This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:
- statements about the positive presence of vaccinations administered are recorded using the ACTION.medication OR
- statements about the positive exclusion of vaccinations administered can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-global; OR
- statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of an administered vaccination nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.">
