This archetype has been specifically designed to carry one, or more, of:
- the EVALUATION.advance_care_directive, representing the preferences of an individual about their future care, from the point of view of the individual or their guardian; and
- the EVALUATION.advance_intervention_decisions archetypes, representing the decisions about the overall intent of care and possible treatments, activities and diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that may be life-saving, life-prolonging or cause undesirable side effects, from the point of view of a clinician; or 
- other archetypes that are clinically relevant and relevant to integrated care or end-of-life planning. 

This archetype can be used as a single COMPOSITION for querying information about any anticipatory care preferences or decisions, with different archetypes clearly differentiating the source of the information as individual or clinician.">
